# quantum-algorithms

The quantum processing system implements several specialized algorithms:

1. Quantum Binary State Analysis (QBSA)
- Pattern state verification with atomic bit operations
- Correction detection and tracking for quantum states 
- Symmetry pair matching using derivative cascade analysis
- Custom rupture detection based on mismatch patterns
- Configurable thresholds: correction_ratio (0.3), stability (0.8)

2. Quantum Fourier Hierarchy (QFH) 
- Multi-scale quantum pattern analysis using wavelet transformations
- Cross-scale rupture detection in frequency hierarchies
- Phase correlation preservation during state transitions
- Coherence calculation using normalized dot products
- Quantum interference calculations with multi-modal fusion

3. Pattern Evolution
- Quantum-inspired mutation system with stability influence
- Coherence decay rate: 0.9 per generation
- Stability influence factor: 0.1
- Edge weights from quantum similarity metrics
- Generation requirements: MTM (5), LTM (100)

4. Coherence Calculation
- Weighted scoring system:
  * 40% coherence value
  * 30% historical stability  
  * 20% generation count
  * 10% access frequency
- Memory tier thresholds:
  * LTM: 0.9 coherence, 0.85 stability
  * MTM: 0.7 coherence
  * STM: 0.1 minimum coherence

5. Stability Determination
- Quantum field theory principles for state updates
- Exponential moving average for stability metrics
- Inverse relationship to fragmentation scores
- Phase correlation tracking between patterns
- Entanglement density calculations
